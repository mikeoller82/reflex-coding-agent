# AutonomousAgent Implementation Plan

## 1. Requirements Analysis
The user wants an "AutonomousAgent" implementation. Based on context, this should be:
- A self-directed agent that can:
  - Make decisions based on environment state
  - Learn from experience
  - Execute actions towards goals
  - Operate independently

## 2. Design Approach
Core components needed:
- Agent base class with core autonomy capabilities
- Environment interface for interaction
- State management system
- Action execution framework
- Learning/adaptation mechanism
- Decision-making engine

## 3. Technology Stack
- Python 3.8+ for implementation
- Type hints for type safety
- Abstract base classes for extensibility
- Asyncio for concurrent operations
- Logging for observability

## 4. Implementation Steps
1. Create core agent interfaces
2. Implement base AutonomousAgent class
3. Add decision engine
4. Implement learning capabilities
5. Add environment interaction layer
6. Create example usage
7. Write comprehensive tests
8. Provide documentation

## 5. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for agent-environment interaction
- Performance tests for decision-making
- Scenario-based testing

## 6. Documentation Plan
- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Design decisions
- Extension guidelines
